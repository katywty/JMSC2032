There are so many hidden meanings that only the viewer can interpret. Some more obvious than others, with some leaving you to make your own conclusion. I have 3 cats. I lost my baby cat Beans who was 3 years old due to a coyote attack. It was one of the rare days I let her outside unsupervised. It was the worst thing I ever experienced in my life, minus my mom passing away from cancer at 57. This film made me think about how fragile life is. I came back home and watered the tree I planted in memory of my cat Beans. It‚Äôs called an Ice Cream bean tree, and I know she‚Äôs up there on top of that mountain with my mom.

Some people complain about the graphics, but I don&#39;t mind. Others take issue with the lack of dialogue, yet, dear viewers, isn&#39;t that the perfect language for animals? Aside from a few exceptions like parrots and crows, I&#39;ve never encountered a cat conversing like a human in real life, nor have I seen a secretary bird telling jokes. That&#39;s precisely the essence of this film.Additionally, some individuals gripe about the lack of explanation. Seriously? If you can&#39;t perceive it, you won&#39;t comprehend it. Earth? Perhaps another planet? Another dimension or time? Where&#39;s your imagination? This movie rightly deserves all its accolades. As for &quot;Wild Robot,&quot; in my opinion, it&#39;s predictable and simplistic, geared more towards children. I watched it once and skipped through the second time. Yes, the jokes are nice, but they&#39;re ones I&#39;ve already seen in other films. &quot;Flow,&quot; however, presents unique humor‚Äîthose you would only find in the natural world of animals.
