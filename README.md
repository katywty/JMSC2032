Love that there were 0% spoken dialogue just non-verbal dialogue and it brought me to tears.

For some reason I was sure it was a cinematic trailer for the game, but it still looks really amazing!
I saw this magnificently beautiful film last night, cried through much of it, and couldn&#39;t move at the end. It made me feel closer to my 13-year-old son Joey who passed away a decade ago. He was an artist, loved drawing Wall-E, and I miss him terribly every second of each day.  I hope he is somewhere creating new art and enjoying this extraordinary piece of work. Kudos to everyone involved in the movie, and my deepest gratitude for the thoughts and memories I experienced while watching.
Dang! I thought that it was a video game, it looked s cool to play like this story and graphics in the video game!
I am dying of cuteness overload! This is everything I&#39;ve ever wanted in an animal-centric movie. Animation, ambient sounds, cute character designs, and a story that takes you on a journey.
Here I am 8 hours after watching this film and taking in what I watched. I haven? been to a theater in 10 years to watch a movie. There are so many hidden meanings that only the viewer can interpret. Some more obvious than others, with some leaving you to make your own conclusion. I have 3 cats. I lost my baby cat Beans who was 3 years old due to a coyote attack. It was one of the rare days I let her outside unsupervised. It was the worst thing I ever experienced in my life, minus my mom passing away from cancer at 57. This film made me think about how fragile life is. I came back home and watered the tree I planted in memory of my cat Beans. It? called an Ice Cream bean tree, and I know she? up there on top of that mountain with my mom. They were both transported to the place we saw on that mountain top. What an amazing film.
Saw a movie today. This was one of the trailers. But the audio was bugged, and there was pretty much no music, so it was just a bunch of animal noises for the most part. My entire theater especially got a chuckle at the silence being broken by the cat scream at 
Best movie of 2024. This little black cat will steal your heart.
Oscar winner ,was just watching trailer for first time n saw that it won in my FB feed,imma watch it
If you think this is some Disney animal adventure you couldn&#39;t be more wrong. I was drawn in from the first moment, lost in a world of true magical realism. Not a word is uttered, you&#39;re just left wondering about the unfamiliar world around you. I have been turning the film over in my head afterwards in the best way.  Deep and delightful , I was very much surprised by this film
Apparently, you don&#39;t even need dialogue to appreciate good content!!!!This movie is just so beautiful!!!!!!Truly deserves the Oscar!!!?  ?  ?  ?  
Just when you thought that truly artistic films didn&#39;t exist anymore, this masterpiece slaps you in the face.
I recently watched this in cinema. For any one doubting, please watch it. It is an absolute beautiful piece of art.
That scene of Cat and Secretarybird in middle of Labyrinth was Absolute Cinema man. The visuals and music took me in a whole another dimension. It was quite emotional which is not what i was expecting.
This movie is balm for the soul. A must see for all humans.
unbelievable, i cant believe it&#39;s come this far. I remember the first teaser years ago. Hope this gets a worldwide release it looks genuinely astonishing. Masterpiece
OSCAR WINNER !!!! Well done !!
I felt so overwhelmed when the film was over??I ended up crying and I didn? know why??the scenes near to the end are the best, I think they did the best representation of transcendence ever, the whole film is a great show of resilience, it the best animated film of the year by far
Im so happy to see my country being able to make such a high quality film. Even if theres no dialogue, this is still one of the greatest movies ive seen in a while :) it shows that a film doesnt have to have voice actors, not even people. Its a great film, and i really recommend it.
Not only my favorite film of 2024 but of all time and I? a 52 year old film snob. FLOW just knocked out all the other auteur cinema high on my list. I will watch it a 3rd time in the movie theater next week.
I am so proud of my fellow countrymen for receiving the Oscar for this beautiful movie ! First Latvian Oscar, very great job ! ?
I went to see this on my birthday. I felt particularly lonely that day on account of not one of my friends showing interest in seeing this movie with me. Thankfully, the tears I shed from watching this remarkable beauty of a film hid the tears I shed from spending my birthday alone. When I got home, I searched the internet for the film&#39;s soundtrack and bought it from i-tunes right away. Easily one of the best films I&#39;ve seen this year.
Latvia you are the Best. We love, we are proud.
Saw this at the cinema in Latvia. Truly an amazing and engaging animation film. A lot deeper than I expected that got a bit too heavy for my 7 year old. But through and through, this movie is spectacular and one where you will take a lot of meaning away about loss, friendship and survival
I adore this movie so much. Watching it felt like a therapeutic experience?ery calming, almost like meditation. Minimalistic and simple, impressive and surprisingly beautiful animation - but the lack of dialogue between the animals made it more emotional, their interactions more meaningful , raw, and also &quot;natural&quot;. And despite having no words spoken in its entire runtime , it was not boring at all. When it won the Golden Globe for Best Animated Feature, I believe it truly deserved it. Some argued that The Wild Robot was robbed, but as an independent film, it managed to stand out. And while I also loved The Wild Robot (both films are similar but also different), I just felt a deeper connection and empathy to the animal characters in Flow.
Congrats on the Oscar. This movie deserves that and more ??thank you for making this movie
I really like that the animals don&#39;t actually talk, like StrayThis was released less than a week after my birthday  :3
The most beautiful movie I&#39;ve ever seen in my entire life. Incredible, fantastic, moving, a true masterpiece!
A successful story of a cultural export from Latvia has won an Oscar award! Amazing! ???
I watched it two days ago, it&#39;s one of the best animation films i&#39;ve seen in years. Prepare tissues!
My goddd.. I just saw this today, and what a beautiful beautiful story! It&#39;s what you need from all the junk and sh*tty things we see on the media today. Give yourself a break and be inspired by this humble little story. They don&#39;t even needs words for you to love it, literally. It&#39;s a cat!
This whole movie had a Spiritual touch to it. First of all, the name Flow indicated the flow in Life that&#39;s intuition. The white bird I felt symbolised suffering, detachment and Transcendence. The Whale showed compassion, hope and resilience. And the changes in nature (life), ups and downs everything is temporary.And the lemur who was attracted to material things in the end found the value of frienship. The value of relationship we have with other beings.Capybara showed kindness and the dog showed life is not that serious, to stay happy.The cat while represents each one of us.All the animals together represented acceptance and to adapt to the adversities in Life and to stand together as One even tho they were all different species. The last scene where they look at the reflection shows they are looking at not the differences but the essence in all of them.And Silence speaks more than words.
Flow becomes the first European animated film to win the golden globe for best animated feature
This looks great! Nobody will probably see this and I&#39;m a grown a** man but shortly after moving in my wife brought her cat from her parents place. He too, was a mischievous void and even though I had known him for some time before that I consider our time together as one of the best of my life. He was such a cool cat, man, he would massage my beard, then we&#39;d nap together, he always worried when we came home after sunset and would wait at the door and yell at us and once a week he had like these funny, crazy 2 minutes where he would be just 500 %, all in. Sadly, he passed away about half a year after moving in with us because of preexisting kidney problems, still get teary eyed when I see pictures or videos of him.Anyway, this kind of reminded me of him so thanks for that. Miss you, little dude.
Just returned from the movie.  The best movie I saw for a looooooong time.  Burst into tears several times. Hug my cats as soon as I got home.  Brilliant ??@galynaliuta904
Best Animated Feature and International Feature nods at Oscars 2025. I&#39;m so happy for this movie!!!
I&#39;m here to tell everyone that this movie now has a good chance of winning the Best Animated Feature award for the Oscars, because it recently won the Golden Globe

Big Respect for the Secretary Bird, At first I was confused what happened to him but after thinking more deeply, Damn. That touched me.
This movie is a masterpiece!     A movie doesn&#39;t need a fancy dialogue to win an award.
I&#39;ve just finished watching this movie 2 hours ago,  and everything was done to perfection. They captured each animal&#39;s mannerism so well &amp; the graphics were so beautiful.  I feel like you can pause randomly, and boom,  instant gorgeous 4K HD wallpaper. I love the camera angles from the cat&#39;s perspective as well, make everything even more grand.     Without spoiling anything:  this film is so much more than just a cute movie with fluffy animals (even though every single one of them is absolutely adorable). You learn a lot about friendship, bravery, selflessness, sacrifice, nature and the circle of life.      To the Director and all the staffs, thank you so much for presenting us with this masterpiece! Brought me to tears so many times, truly an exceptional experience.
This is one of the best animated movies of all time, in my opinion. It&#39;s beautiful, adorable, funny as hell, and just overall wonderful
(For all the people who haven? watched it) I totally recommend it! It doesn? have any words however that works really well. It felt fresh and I cried multiple times. Animation is also beautiful! I?e never seen anything like it. I think it? a cinematic masterpiece and you should totally see it!
Beware : Do not watch this movie, it will absolutely wreck your emotional well-being in minutes.  Seriously, it got me crying in under 9 minutes.  It&#39;s a beautiful film, every bit of scenery is gorgeous, and especially the music. It brings the whole thing together and manages to manipulate your feelings so well. The fact that there is no spoken dialogue in this also make it unique.    This deserves to win the best film of the year award.
By far my favourite movie of the year! I don? think I?e ever felt so much empathy for a character in a movie. Watching it felt like a meditative experience! It? so so beautiful! Definitely worth seeing in the cinema ?歹?
there&#39;s a movies beyond words to describe. and this is absolutely one of them  . one of the best animation movies i have ever seen.
Best. Film. Ever.   Masterpiece.
This movie deserves all the money in the world and every award it has and will receive.  Huge thanks to director Gints Zilbalodis and everyone involved in the creation of this masterpiece.
they just win an Oscar!, congrats flow
Latvians can do anything. THEIR song festivals are amazing

Congrats to Flow for winning the Oscar for Best Animated Feature!
A masterpiece full of beauty, hope and majestic sadness. World of humans is over, but humanity is on.
It&#39;s amazing that an indie studio is able to reach a wide range of audience! Flow is truly remarkable and beautiful, yet very peaceful and fun to watch.
By the end of the trailer I was actually brought to tears. This cat looks so much like my Lucy who passed away last year. I wish she could&#39;ve been there watching the movie with me. Somehow this cat&#39;s meows sound eerily similar to hers ??
Very heartfelt movie which has been awaited for decades.

This movie need an Oscar
Why do I feel like crying just from watching this trailer?  
This is the first animated film without dialogue to win the Oscar for &#39;Best Animated Feature Film&#39;
After a couple minutes of the most different production company logos I&#39;ve ever seen (I thought I was watching a Family Guy parody of them at times) this ends up being the most moving and affecting film I&#39;ve seen in years. Days later and I still think of scenes and get emotional. I hope people will keep discovering this wonderful work of art.
This trailer came out right when my city was flooded.  I appreciate the timing, but but I think I am not emotionally ready for this film yet. I will make sure to watch it some day, though. Looks fantastic.
...we don&#39;t have anything just a soul and time. Thanks for the meaning without words. LOVE IT. Paldies.
Just saw this. Amazing experience. It&#39;s more then a movie. Says so much, without a single human speaking. Phenomenal.
This Movie deserves to win an OSCAR for best animated movie.  It is done beautifully,
Best movie of the year, and it&#39;s not close &lt;3 such an impressive feat of filmmaking
IF THIS DOESNT GET THE ATTENTION IT DESERVES, I WILL EXPLODE!!  THIS IS AMAZING, THE WAY EACH CHARACTER IS NOT OUT OF CHARACTER BUT INSTEAD IN CHARACTER; ANIMALS. The fact you are able to make such a project without making the animals talk at all is ABSOLUTELY UNIQUE AND MASTERPIECE.
Saw it in the cinema the other day and wow, worth it. Was so beautiful to simply experience it all with no words needed.
Just came from the theatre, it&#39;s one of the best animation movies i&#39;ve ever seen, no exageration. If you have the chance go see it.
Just watched - no words, but such an amazing film. Please please PLEASE go watch it with your family!!
Easily the best animated movie of the year, and one of the most unique theatrical experiences I&#39;ve ever had.
No dialogue, just amazing cinematography &amp; masterpiece
Saw this trailer last November and recall getting that ? really want to check that out??vibe; I last felt like that when I saw the first trailer for Everything Everywhere All At Once.    And then I heard it beat out all the big players for the golden globe this month??at less than 2% Inside Out 2? budget.    And they did it in BLENDER. Just from rigging 3D models for printing I know how hard it is to use that app??and they made it look AMAZING.    And it grips you almost immediately; some might hate the fact that you have to pay attention thanks to the complete lack of dialogue, but it only immerses you even deeper into this surreal animal buddy movie meets Myst.    It? PG??there are a few scenes that could give younger viewers nightmares. Hell, I think I? going to have some weird dreams tonight.    It? so nice to have a story unfold before you without being spoon fed or narrated at. If it doesn? win the Oscar (or worse, is snubbed) it? because Hollywood is scared.    And should be.
Definitely on my Have to see list. No dialogue only the music. Hope this becomes a hit and an Oscar winner.
This movie was so good it had me STRESSING over the safety of a bunch of fictional animals. 10/10
Theres No Voice Actors Thats amazing
This is one of the best animated films I have seen in years
It won Golden Globes!
Love this movie, funny, heart warming and cute. Not a single word but 10/10
Amazing movie. I wish I could delete it from my mind so I could watch it again and be mesmerized AGAIN. Brilliant ??@daniloramos8088

Just came back from the theater... Amazing movie, genuinely amazing.
Apparently this film was completly rendered in EVEE
Congratulations for winning the Oscars ???? really deserve it!!!
I just saw the movie a few hours ago. I only found out about it after seeing an ad on Instagram this morning. Seeing it was one of the best quick decisions I&#39;ve made lately. I love cats, and this movie gets a lot right and has its own story to tell. Yes, it has shortcomings, but I like to say I enjoyed the movie!
I watched this movie at a film festival and let me say if you can watch in a theatre it? a TREAT! Such a beautiful and profound film ????

I watched this movie week ago   I felt so heartwarming that how the animals together can survive or make their own family   I dont know why the drastic water level was increasing and why were so many cat status as developers didn&#39;t mentioned but the emotions were fantastic and graphics was also good ??@Inexhaustible01
What an amazing film! The world needs more of this! A new one to add to my top twenty films of all time...
Goddamnit what a movie it is! Please, guys, go to the cinema and watch it. Let&#39;s show these big movie companies that masterpiece can still be created with a fraction of a budget. 9/10 from me, truly remarkable film.
Thank you Penguinz0, now I&#39;ll go watch this movie
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR OSCAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The little mews had me in tears!!!  Cats are such glorious, curious, rambunctious little beings....but also scared, aloof and solitary floofballs.  Would love to go see this when it released in more theaters.  I just adore cats....all of them....BIG and small.  ??????
You guys should be contracted for a Warriors movie, because this is beautiful.
I love this movie. Especially after the last shot, I mean the very last one (after the credits). It brought the whole thing together. Even I cried.
I really loved this movie. ?low??is a work of art, a truly beautiful film ??歹?

As one said in youtube review - &#39;This is defibrillator to your soul&#39;. I agree no less.
Saw this movie and gotta say, what a beautiful experience
Go Flow for the Oscar!
Saw it last night.  It&#39;s a masterpiece. Jaw droppingly beautiful.
Im proud of this being created with blender, I wish you guys who made it win an OSCAR! Greetings from Brazil!!!!!

Every second is soo beautiful. No dull moments.

Thoroughly loved the movie. Absolutely mesmerizing and cried at the end ???@ParadoxicalSerenity
wonderful movie, I loved it, greetings from Brazil??????Oscar more than deserved??
I felt it was done during Covid and the collective fear and loneliness were so relatable. True art depicting Life? beauty and sadness. Reminds me of the kind and not so kind people we met through life? journey.
Stunning! Can&#39;t wait to watch it!
And this is what i was hoping the wild robot would be after the first trailer, but they had to add in talking animals with celebrity voices ??
it was a unique experience, I&#39;ll definitely watch it again, tears of sadness and joy fr
i think i&#39;ll cry if i watch this movie. not from the story, but from how incredible the animation is. like i might start sobbing
Used to have a little black cat named flow. I feel like I? watching him run around again! so cute
My first thought was how quiet it felt. What an absolute banger of a trailer feels
Marvelous. Love from Brasil.
I&#39;ve read an overwhelming number of comments about this masterpiece. Some people complain about the graphics, but I don&#39;t mind. Others take issue with the lack of dialogue, yet, dear viewers, isn&#39;t that the perfect language for animals? Aside from a few exceptions like parrots and crows, I&#39;ve never encountered a cat conversing like a human in real life, nor have I seen a secretary bird telling jokes. That&#39;s precisely the essence of this film.Additionally, some individuals gripe about the lack of explanation. Seriously? If you can&#39;t perceive it, you won&#39;t comprehend it. Earth? Perhaps another planet? Another dimension or time? Where&#39;s your imagination? This movie rightly deserves all its accolades. As for &quot;Wild Robot,&quot; in my opinion, it&#39;s predictable and simplistic, geared more towards children. I watched it once and skipped through the second time. Yes, the jokes are nice, but they&#39;re ones I&#39;ve already seen in other films. &quot;Flow,&quot; however, presents unique humor?hose you would only find in the natural world of animals. I feel sorry for those who didn&#39;t understand it. I rate it a 10/10.
Fiquei feliz de saber que esse filme ganhou um Oscar! Parabns a todos que se esforaram pra fazer isso!   Abrao a todos da Letnia
The best thing about this masterpiece is that it is made on a free open source software called blender
Please continue making extraordinary work! This is what the world needs more of :)
This is my favorite animated film of 2024
Silent movie but powerful, brilliant spectacular amazing...??
This movie deserves an Oscar!
I don? want to give anything away, but man this hit.
? In loving memory of my sweet Puma, who looked just like this kitty, I would love to see &quot;FLOW&quot; in theaters!
Visual poetry.
Both me and my daughter cried through this. It&#39;s an excellent motion picture which carries so much emotion.
This movie. THIS MOVIE MADE ME CRY WHITOUT ANY DIALOGUE
Beautiful and moving story.
I watched this earlier today. I  was surprised by it! Didn&#39;t realise going in that it had zero dialogue but the storytelling was SO well done. Beautiful film!
Just saw the full movie of this at the Ottawa Film Festival- I STRONGLY RECOMMEND. Dear god it&#39;s absolutely beautiful and i almost cried multiple times    The environment design is beautiful, the music is amazing and the animal behaviors are so well animated  (This is coming from an animation student so im biased but holy HELL GO WATCH THIS.)
The big film of the small Baltic country Latvia for the whole world! Enjoy! It&#39;s unique and beautiful!Flow!
Hermosa, los mensajes que tiene, los animalitos hermosos. Las expresiones del gatito , movimientos y comportamiento tan similares a la realidad  Simplemente preciosa
100 % well deserved Oscar ?? , so happy for you guys although I thought The wild robot would win what a tough choice ??
Hands down one of the best movies I have ever watched ????
10/10 film highly recommend anyone who gets the chance to watch it
 Since BAMBI! Well, well, well I have some high hopes for this!
The incredible thing about this presentation, is that all animals of almost every species has been observed to be truly altruistic without any expectation of return in nature. Especially from species to another species. Thousands of examples have been filmed. It happens all the time, we&#39;re just not always paying attention. Also, remember this when the floods come.
Congrats on the Oscar!
For animal lovers, this by far one of my favorite animated movie ever watch. This movie should be nominated for Oscar 2025.
CAT?? WORLD TOUR??? EPIC BOAT RIDE??? BREATHTAKING SCENERIES??? COUNT ME IN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This movie just won a golden globe
"Absolutely brilliant movie. The trailer, good as it is, does it no justice!
  It&#39;s one of those remarkable classics that is simple, beautiful and full of life wisdoms!
  Watch it with your kids, watch it alone, watch it when you&#39;re happy or sad, rich or poor, watch it when you&#39;re 6, 16, 46, 66, or 96! I nearly wrote it off as &#39;just another kids animation with silly anthropomorphized animals but it&#39;s more!"
Came to check it out after it won an Oscar.
I dont even know what to say. I love the entire plot and the characters, its very original, inspiring, and definitely hooked me in as soon as I saw this! All I have to do is watch 10 seconds of ANY part and I&#39;m blown away. All that, plus the style and animation too. So looking forward to this!!
I love the artstyle so much, it&#39;s got dynamic lights but still a painting look.
One of the best animation movies ever, and best from last year!
The trailer beautifully captures the essence of survival and teamwork.
This movie makes you FEEL
Feel sad and lonely. A world destroyed by the mother nature. Animals struggle for survival and still be so cheerful.
I&#39;m very proud! ??
The whole movie felt like a meditation to me ,so peaceful ??
Oscar winner ??
I watched the movie at my aunts work friends daughters birthday party! It was so good, and it was amazing how they display emotion and dialogue via body language! My favorite parts were when the cat was catching fish and the part where the poor little secretary was defending the cat :)
Cried from start to finish. I&#39;m easy.
I think this movie has a strong message that one day we will end up like those animals if we don&#39;t get our shit together. The ending was tragic especially after the post credits scene
HERMOSA PELICULA POR DIOS MERECES EL OSCAR ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  
I drank way too much soda before the movie and desperately had to pee half way through, but I didn&#39;t dare leave. Then the movie picked up and I completely forgot I had to pee.
This is EXACTLY the kind of film I&#39;ve been looking for! Something that doesn&#39;t rely on dialogue but emotion, music, and lighting!! I&#39;m so excited to see how this turns out :]
Congratulations on winning Oscars Award
one of the most beautiful move
I just saw this movie and it&#39;s a masterpiece.
Loved the film. Wonderful
This was the best movie I have ever seen. It made me sooo emotional and kept me on the edge of my seat. There were a couple of scenes that really pulled at my heart strings. Go see it!
ANIMATION OF THE YEAR! The best ??@ThiagoFregnani
I went to see this in a theater and it was a surreal experience
Congrats ??
What a relief! Together, we can ???
I feel like this movie will actually be what I thought Wild Robot would be like! Can&#39;t wait!
this was a phenomenal film
I saw this movie almost two weeks ago with my mom. I was super hyped because I&#39;ve been seeing the trailers since the summer, but my mom didn&#39;t really know what to expect. We ended up absolutely loving it. The story was enthralling and I was able to understand the characters&#39; personalities and motivations without the use of dialogue. The animation also made the absolute most out of its tiny budget.?  I&#39;m so happy that this amazing movie won the Golden Globe for Best Animated Feature and that it not only got nominated for Best Animated Feature at the Academy Awards, but it also got nominated for Best International Feature (the first Latvian film and the third animated film to get nominated for this category).
 im sold ??
Love that there were 0% spoken dialogue just non-verbal dialogue and it brought me to tears.
100 % well deserved Oscar ?? , so happy for you guys although I thought The wild robot would win what a tough choice ??
Congrats on the Oscar win! I was hoping for this one to win it, and glad it did! I can just imagine the animals showing up and accepting the Oscar.
I watched this in cinema, it was really good
Saw this movie yesterday , was very good.
Even though the idea/concept is not original, not exactly low in quantity, movies like this are still such a breath of fresh air in the modern film industry.
I just watched this. Very good and well done!
this is... pure art
Saw this and cried the ENTIRE TIME!! Such a good movie!
Wonderful Film,  saw it today.
I&#39;m gonna go see this next weekend with my brother.  I&#39;m so excited!!
So I just watched this and I&#39;m still ugly crying rn.  A movie without dialogue left me with more feels than any other.     The storytelling in this was incredible. Like it leaves you staring at the movie the whole time!  Thanks to that short that introduced me to this movie, I wouldn&#39;t have just stashed it on my waiting list that won&#39;t be viewed anytime soon.  Truly found a gem ?旦

WOW!     Just finished watching this amazing, beautiful, utterly bewildering movie!     It&#39;s one of the few pieces of fiction of any sort, either written or visual, that left me believing that there is an endless depth of symbolism and analogy in it, but that the very best way to interpret it is to just take it at face value and let it breathe. It doesn&#39;t need me to understand it.     If there is any justice at all, it will win the Best Animated Movie of the year at every awards show that offers such a prize.     Which means it&#39;ll probably get completely ignored.     I can&#39;t wait to watch it again &amp; I can&#39;t wait to see what masterworks the director has up his sleeves next!     THIS is what animation is meant to do.
Loved this movie! For me, dialog wasn&#39;t needed. You can understand it without words just from expressions. I&#39;ve had a cat who drowned, I have seen a cat being taken by an eagle. So for those scenes I couldn&#39;t go without crying, seeing the despair, the panic... Jesus... made me think about my lost kitties. Last year, I lost my 8 year old cat, my best friend... so yeah, this was tough for me??
You came here after Oscar&gt;&gt;&gt;
I loved this very much! I adore mediums where there is no dialogue, like the game Little Nightmares.
Tomara que ganhe o oscar de melhor anima癟瓊o ?歹????歹????歹?

Since I don&#39;t trust cinema distributors, I beg you, please give us a way to acquire this movie: not even 2 minutes of a trailer and I know in my heart I wanna have this in my collection.
OMG! And no voice actors, so it is as real as it could be! Thank you!
I was totally high when I watched it. Dude, I slipped into a fantasy I? never experienced before.
All I can say is ....WOW!!
Happy to see a Blender artist hitting one out of the park.
A touching tale of unity in adversity. Can&#39;t wait to watch! ??
Thank you to the brilliant mind behind this incredible animated movie! Your creativity and vision are truly inspiring. ???    ??
Fantastiski. Labs darbs!
I saw it at the local Regal and I loved it!  It is for animal lovers and there are no spoken words. The movie has animals communicating.??@dawnlosey5228
Movie of the Century
I hope after watching this masterpiece people will adopt more black cats.

Not many movies have brought me close to tears multiple times through out the run time like this one.

A Hymn to Non-Commercial Animated Cinema.
I had a black cat like this but now he went to the heaven. I miss him so much. When I see this movie. It feels that I see my cat. I hope that I will see your movie in Thailand. ????
This was such an amazing movie!
Congratulations on your Golden Globe win
One of the best animated films I?e ever seen. Incredible work
?? ? ?? CAMPE?O!! ???? ?? ? ?? CAMPE?O!! ???????兩
I thought, this was a game, the cat looks like the cat from &quot;Little Kitty, Big City&quot; and this could have been a sequel.
At the very end of the film, after all of the credits, my heart tells me that Leviathan swimming away is the same one that we saw beached earlier.
best movie in a long time!
10/10 beautiful movie.
In re any awards controversy:  The Wild Robot is based on a series of successful childrens&#39; books.  Flow is...original.  You follow the Wild robot.  You immerse yourself in flow.
Congratulations Golden Globe Has Won Flow
You made a masterpiece.
Saw this tonight and it was fantastic! The Capybara at :26 was the perfect animal. Perfect for kids and a nice change from the same old thing from Disney.
I love the movie!!
Congratulations on the best animation movie award ??
I heard people loved this when it came out in France I think. Super excited to watch it when it comes out near me or digital :)
Congratulations on winning the Golden Globe! ??
I loved it! Beautiful and sweet film! :)
Wow just wow...Looks incredible. Count me in.
I watched this film and it was amazing
THIS DESERVES SUCCESS
"It really gave me a lot of questions after the bird just randomly left the entire falling action. Somehow, it gave me the interpretation that the tower grants *wish*. If you study the characters of the animals closely (even in real life) birds tend to k!ll themselves when separated from the group or their partners. (1) The crane got abandoned by its group, and (2) The bird knows that the cat knows that those dogs were bad news, yet the cat still gave empathy to the dogs, maybe the crane felt betrayed by it and lost hope?

In the end, they went to the tower, (i remembered the weathering with you scene, where the girl wishes for the rain to stopped, and similar situation wherein the scene (floating, water evaporates, a glimpse of heaven).
Maybe the crane gave up and wishes to go to heaven? maybe the cat also wished for the water level to go down/ wishes for some land?
or maybe the white crane wished that the animals would be safe by asking for trees, lands, and etc.- AND THERE the price for asking such wish costs the life of the white crane? (again this is weathering with you reference. With oriental beliefs that &quot;Every wish comes with a price&quot;)
Although there are many interpretations that the audience could think of, we are still united by the fact that this movie touches the heart of every man. Even without dialogue, this journey of a cat is a very heartwarming and wholesome one, it&#39;s been so long since I&#39;ve seen these type of movies. The movements, actions, symbolism, and its theme are spot on!
Almost burst into tears when I saw the whale, I thought it survived.. and maybe.. that&#39;s where the cat realized (that also reminded me) that &quot;one&#39;s comfort, is another&#39;s suffering.&quot;"
Thank you Penguinz0 for the recommendation ??@aretinodaniels3620

Hermoso.. Me gusto mucho ?予?予
peak fiction,glorious cinema
"This concept seems like someone took Life of Pi, removed the human beings and turned it into an animated movie movie but I&#39;d bet my bottom dollar that each animal&#39;s natural instincts and &quot;personality&quot; traits represent different types of people and the concept seems to be that other people, although seemingly eccentric or not typical in nature to the type you would normally go for to become friends with, can build you up to step out of your comfort zone to make you see the world from a different and more beautiful perspective. Cool stuff ??,@yaya804,1
